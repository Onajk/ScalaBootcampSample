# ScalaBootcampSample
Code sample for scala bootcamp application made by Paweł Kędzierski.

C# WPF Application (.Net) with MVVM architecture.

I could not include any of my applications from current or previous job so I made this one.
In general at work I make applications like screen recorder app that is overlaying on SCADA system and operators can interact with it to record screen video of what they are doing. Or application that is reading alarms from SQL Server and if there is a new one then proper messages are sent to operators on email addresses.

Application presents:
- usage of MVVM architecture
- Tic Tac Toe game with implemented min-max algorithm
- make, edit and delete notes stored in database
- usage of Google Books API to search for books
